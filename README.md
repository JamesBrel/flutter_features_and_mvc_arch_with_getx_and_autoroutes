## Architecture 
   the architecture of each feature is based on the MVC :
   - Controllers
   - Models
   - Views

```
ðŸ“¦features
 â”— ðŸ“‚greeting
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚controllers
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚models
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚views
```

## Usage and Configuration

Once you have created your application or flutter project, you clone the architecture from Github, to start on a good basis

Note: 
the predefined files, such as welcome.dart in the front end and other folders, as well as example_test file, are only files that will allow you to be on the right track and to get a good understanding of the architecture.
